              I graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Lowell with a bachelors in Sound Recording Technology. I have since started to further my education by pursing web development through the Lambda School program.

      </article>
         <p>As a recent college graduate I am familiar with typical pitfalls that comes
            with education and has granted me the ability to become a more efficient and
            enthusiastic learner. Likewise becoming a foster parent has taught me very similar lessons.
            After I finish the Lambda program, I plan to find a job 
            as a full-stack web developer. With my degree in Sound Recoding Technology (which
            focused on both the art of music and the technical knowledge of how all
            recoding equipment functioned and using that to, in turn, highlight the 
            art of the music) I feel that I have a balanced mind for aesthetic and 
            technological detail.  </p>

         <p> Aside from all of my skill in the music/audio field, I am currently growing my skills in Web development. I am currently studying HTML, CSS and Javascript. Furthermore, I am learning how to use Less, DOM manipulation and React. Most of my work is collaborated on using Github.  </p>
