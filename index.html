          <p>
              I am the youngest son of Hamfast and Bell Gamgee, and have many brothers and sisters. A gardener by trade, I'm a simple Hobbit of plain speech. However, my love for Elves, gift for poetry, and belief that the world contained greater wonders than most hobbits were aware of (all nurtured by his tutor Bilbo Baggins) sets me apart from the beginning.

        <h2>Intro</h2>
         <p>I live with his father, Hamfast Gamgee, known commonly as "The Gaffer", on Bagshot Row in the Shire, close to Bag End. My mother was Bell Goodchild. I have five siblings: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, and Marigold. </p>

         <h2>Skills</h2>
         <p> I am a mighty fine gardener and you can see most of my handywork around the shire. I'm also a decent cook, my favorite meal would have to be a brace of coneys boiled up in aa stew. Maybe with some 'taters on the side!'. I have quite a dogged personality and won't give up when times get rough. </p>

         <p>
            My gardening work around my property and all around the Shire as well should stand as proof enough that I have what it takes to be your gardener!
